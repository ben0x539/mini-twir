Mini-TWIR
=========

Some negliently crappy javascript to bother the github jsonp API for the last
week's worth merge commits/merged pull requests. Intended as a sort of cheap
knockoff of [@cmr](https://github.com/cmr)'s awesome [This Week in
Rust](http://blog.octayn.net/) newsletter.

Since I'm not a real github app, this thing only even runs a couple of times
before being rate-limited by github for the rest of the hour. Don't browse to
the html if you need your hourly anonymous github API allowance for something
else!

It's also vaguely untested outside of Firefox because I ran out of said API
allowance, whoops!
